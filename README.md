## General info
I created this tool in ~ 18 hours so it might have bugs. If you see something wrong, then contect me via Discord, Rage.MP or create an issue.



## Setup
+ To run this project, you need to have .NET installed
+ You need to have admin-rights to read/write data!

1. Open
2. Select Save directory
3. Select your vehicle textures
4. Select the [GTAUtil](https://github.com/indilo53/gtautil). (must be the latest release!)
5. Enable .meta's you want to use.
6. Import the .meta
7. Select a filename
8. Convert
9. Look into your folder. You'll see a directory and a dlc.rpf. You can delete the directory!
```

```
